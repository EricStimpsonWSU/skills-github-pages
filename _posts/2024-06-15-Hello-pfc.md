This is a test of the PFC broadcast system.  This is just a test.  If this were an actual broadcast, expect to see lots of technical details, mathematics, code, pictures, and more!

Some math:

\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]

```c
// Please be real!? ;-)
double* quadraticRoots (double a, double b, double c)
{
  double x[2];
  x[0] = (-b - sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c))/(2*a);
  x[1] = (-b + sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c))/(2*a);
  return x;
}
```

Next time, a real broadcast!
