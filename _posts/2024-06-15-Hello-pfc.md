This is a test of the PFC broadcast system.  This is just a test.  If this were an actual broadcast, expect to see lots of technical details, mathematics, code, pictures, and more!

Some math:
```math
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}
```

{% raw %}
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}$$
{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
{% endraw %}

```c
// Please be real!? ;-)
double* quadraticRoots (double a, double b, double c)
{
  double x[2];
  x[0] = (-b - sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c))/(2*a);
  x[1] = (-b + sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c))/(2*a);
  return x;
}
```

Next time, a real broadcast!
